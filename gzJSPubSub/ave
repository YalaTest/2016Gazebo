       npm  is  the  package manager for the Node JavaScript platform. It puts
       modules in place so that node can find  them,  and  manages  dependency
       conflicts intelligently.

       It  is  extremely  configurable to support a wide variety of use cases.
       Most commonly, it is used to publish, discover,  install,  and  develop
       node programs.

       Run nnppmm hheellpp to get a list of available commands.

       You probably got npm because you want to install stuff.

       npm  help  Use  nnppmm  iinnssttaallll  bblleerrgg  to  install  the latest version of
       "blerg". Check out nnppmm--iinnssttaallll for more info. It can do a lot of stuff.

       Use the nnppmm sseeaarrcchh command to show everything that´s available. Use nnppmm
       llss to show everything you´ve installed.

       npm help  See nnppmm--ffoollddeerrss to learn about where npm puts stuff.

       In particular, npm has two modes of operation:

       global mode:
              npm   installs   packages   into  the  install  prefix  at  pprree‐‐
              ffiixx//lliibb//nnooddee__mmoodduulleess and bins are installed in pprreeffiixx//bbiinn.


       local mode:
              npm installs packages into the current project directory,  which
              defaults   to   the  current  working  directory.  Packages  are
              installed  to  ..//nnooddee__mmoodduulleess,  and  bins   are   installed   to
              ..//nnooddee__mmoodduulleess//..bbiinn.


       Local mode is the default. Use ----gglloobbaall or --gg on any command to operate
       in global mode instead.

       If you´re using npm to develop and publish your  code,  check  out  the
       following help topics:

       json   npm help  Make a package.json file. See ppaacckkaaggee..jjssoonn.

       link   For  linking your current working code into Node´s path, so that
              you don´t have to reinstall every time you make  a  change.  Use
              nnppmm lliinnkk to do this.

       install
              It´s  a  good  idea to install things if you don´t need the sym‐
              bolic link. Especially, installing other peoples code  from  the
              registry is done via nnppmm iinnssttaallll

       adduser
              Create  an account or log in. Credentials are stored in the user
              config file.

       publish
              Use the nnppmm ppuubblliisshh command to upload your code to the registry.

CCOONNFFIIGGUURRAATTIIOONN
       npm is extremely configurable. It reads its configuration options  from
       5 places.

       Command line switches:
              Set a config with ----kkeeyy vvaall. All keys take a value, even if they
              are booleans (the config parser doesn´t know  what  the  options
              are  at  the time of parsing.) If no value is provided, then the
              option is set to boolean ttrruuee.


       Environment Variables:
              Set any config by prefixing the name in an environment  variable
              with nnppmm__ccoonnffiigg__. For example, eexxppoorrtt nnppmm__ccoonnffiigg__kkeeyy==vvaall.


       User Configs:
              The file at $HOME/.npmrc is an ini-formatted list of configs. If
              present, it is parsed. If the uusseerrccoonnffiigg option is  set  in  the
              cli or env, then that will be used instead.


       Global Configs:
              The  file  found  at  ../etc/npmrc (from the node executable, by
              default this resolves to /usr/local/etc/npmrc) will be parsed if
              it  is found. If the gglloobbaallccoonnffiigg option is set in the cli, env,
              or user config, then that file is parsed instead.


       Defaults:
              npm´s   default   configuration   options   are    defined    in
              lib/utils/config-defs.js. These must not be changed.
